            <p>Parakeets are like parrots but are smaller and have longer tails. Parakeets tend to live in warmer tropical climates like a jungle. They are often kept in cages indoors as pets. These birds flaunt a variety of colors. You can tell male and female parakeets apart by the color under their bill which is blue for males and brownish pink for females (britannica.com).</p>
